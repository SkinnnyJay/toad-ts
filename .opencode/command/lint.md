# Format and Lint

## Overview

Fix all linting and formatting issues across the project. When fixing remaining issues, follow the project's fixing workflow.

## Steps

1. **Run lint**
   - Run `npm run lint` to discover ALL issues
   - Read the complete output

2. **Auto-fix**
   - Run `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run format` to fix what can be auto-fixed

3. **Create task list**
   - Run `npm run lint` again
   - Catalog every remaining error: file path, rule, description
   - Mark all items as pending

4. **Fix issues systematically**
   - Fix one issue at a time
   - Read the file and understand the violation
   - Apply minimal, correct fix (never use `any` to silence type errors)
   - Verify with: `npx biome check <file>`
   - Mark done only after it passes

5. **Do not re-run full lint** until all items are individually resolved

6. **Full confirmation**
   - Run `npm run lint`; handle any regressions

7. **Final gate:** `npm run typecheck`
