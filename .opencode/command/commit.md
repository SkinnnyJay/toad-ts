# Commit Changes

## Overview

Group changed files into logical, atomic commits using the project's conventional commit format. Ensure code quality gates pass before committing.

## Steps

1. **Review changes**
   - Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` to see all changes

2. **Plan commits**
   - Group changed files into logical, atomic commits
   - Use format: `toad:<type>(<scope>): <summary>`
   - Types: feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, test
   - Present tense, imperative mood, under 72 characters

3. **Quality gate**
   - Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck` before committing

4. **Commit**
   - Stage each group and commit separately

5. **Never commit** `.env`, credentials, or secrets
