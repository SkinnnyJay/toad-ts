# Current Execution Plan

## Phase
- Execution hardening after PLAN3 completion.

## Objectives
- Keep PLAN3 tasks at 100% completion with regression-resistant coverage.
- Continue literal-hygiene and fallback-behavior hardening where small gaps remain.
- Preserve green quality gates after each meaningful change.

## Active Workstream
1. Strengthen fallback and feature-flag behavior tests around harness/config loading.
2. Expand focused unit coverage for server and workflow edge cases.
3. Keep strict literal checks green.

## Exit Criteria
- PLAN3 remains fully checked and validated.
- No quality-gate regressions (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`).
- New hardening increments documented in PLAN3 execution log.
